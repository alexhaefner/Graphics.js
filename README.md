Graphics.js
===========

Helper Library for easy 3D graphics on the web.  Currently quite early.  Consider this a pre-v1.0 product.


Graphics.js makes it easy to create scenes with a set of dependencies (shaders, textures) and will wait until all those resources are available to begin rendering.  The intent is to package WebGL in an easier to use format.
